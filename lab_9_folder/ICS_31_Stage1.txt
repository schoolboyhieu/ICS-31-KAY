## This is a sample command file for the Anteater BandB, Stage IV
## First, add some bedrooms:
nb 101
NB 102
NB 103
## Now make some reservations:
NR 101 12/17/2012 12/19/2012 Claude Crillon
NR 102 12/31/2012  1/5/2013 Donald Dorchester
## Try a few reservations that go backwards in time:
NR 103 11/3/2012 12/15/1989 Bonnie Bonaventure
NR 103 12/17/2012 11/18/2012 Osamu Okura
NR 103 12/31/2012 12/25/2012 Penelope Peninsula
## And one that comes and goes on the same date:
NR 103 12/1/2012 12/1/2012 Randolph Raffles
LR
## Now try some conflicting reservations
## One that overlaps exactly:
nr 101 12/17/2012 12/19/2012 George Cinq
## One that overlaps a couple of days:
nr 102 12/25/2012  1/1/2013 Renata Rossiya
## One that's completely contained:
nr 102 1/1/2013 1/3/2013 Mark Hopkins
## And one that doesn't conflict, barely:
nr 102 12/25/2012 12/31/2012 Belle Air
LR
## Now try to add an already-existing bedroom:
NB 103
## Finally, delete a bedroom (which cancels all its reservations):
rb 102
nr 103 12/17/2012 12/19/2012 Alfreda Algonquin
PL The final list of reservations:
LR
PL Thank you for confusing the Anteater BandB Reservation System!
## That's the end of the sample data for Stage IV.
